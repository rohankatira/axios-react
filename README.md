## **3. ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture & Core Stack**

ProductFlow is architected upon a foundation of robust, industry-leading technologies, meticulously selected to ensure unparalleled performance, inherent scalability, and long-term maintainability.

### **3.1. üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Overview**

The application adheres to a highly efficient client-server model, optimized for responsiveness, data integrity, and modularity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Browser] -->|Interacts with| B(React Frontend)
    B -->|HTTP Requests (Axios)| C(JSON Server Backend)
    C -->|Reads/Writes| D[db.json]
```

*   **Frontend (Client-Side):** The dynamic and interactive user interface, meticulously crafted with **React.js**, executes within the user's web browser. It manages all presentation logic, user interactions, and client-side state, delivering a fluid and responsive experience.
*   **Backend (Server-Side):** A lightweight, local RESTful API, expertly simulated by **JSON Server**, orchestrates data persistence by efficiently reading from and writing to a `db.json` file. For enterprise-grade production deployments, this component is designed to be seamlessly replaced by a robust, scalable API server backed by a high-performance database solution.
*   **Communication Layer:** **Axios**, a powerful promise-based HTTP client, facilitates all asynchronous data exchange between the frontend and backend. Its efficient handling of HTTP requests ensures seamless, reliable, and high-performance API calls, critical for a responsive application.

### **3.2. üíª Core Technology Stack**
*   **Frontend Framework:** **‚öõÔ∏è React.js** (leveraging modern Hooks for efficient state management and optimized component rendering, ensuring a highly performant UI)
*   **Routing Solution:** **üîó React Router DOM** (for intuitive, declarative, and seamless client-side navigation within the Single Page Application, enhancing user flow)
*   **HTTP Client:** **üì° Axios** (for robust, streamlined, and promise-based API communication, simplifying data interactions)
*   **Backend Simulation:** **üì¶ JSON Server** (a rapid prototyping tool providing a full fake REST API with zero coding, significantly accelerating local development and testing cycles)
*   **UI Framework:** **üé® Bootstrap** (providing the elegant, responsive design and a rich library of pre-built UI components, ensuring a polished, professional aesthetic, and consistent user experience across all devices and platforms)
*   **Development Environment:** **üü¢ Node.js** and **npm/Yarn** (for comprehensive package management, build processes, and development tooling)

### **3.3. üìä Data Flow & Lifecycle Management**
1.  **Data Initialization:** Upon application load, `App.jsx` intelligently initiates an `axios.get` request to fetch all product data from JSON Server, seamlessly populating the `productsData` state for immediate display within the Data Table.
2.  **Create/Update Operations:**
    *   User input in `Form.jsx` is precisely captured via the `handleChange` event handler.
    *   Upon `handleSubmit`, data undergoes rigorous client-side validation to ensure integrity.
    *   Validated data is then transmitted to JSON Server via `axios.post` (for new product creation) or `axios.put` (for existing product updates).
    *   Post-operation, the `handleFetch` function is automatically invoked to refresh the `productsData` state, and the user is intuitively navigated to the Data Table, confirming the data update.
3.  **Delete Operations:**
    *   The `handleDelete` function dispatches an `axios.delete` request to JSON Server for the specified product ID.
    *   The `handleFetch` function is subsequently called to update the `productsData` state, reflecting the immediate and permanent removal of the product from the displayed inventory.

## **4. üöÄ Getting Started: Deployment & Access**

ProductFlow offers flexible deployment options, enabling access via a live hosted environment or through a robust local development setup, catering to diverse operational needs.

### **4.1. üåê Live Deployment Access**
*   **Access ProductFlow Online:** Experience the application directly via its publicly deployed link, designed for optimal performance and availability:
    **[https://axios-react-ysas.vercel.app/]**
    *(Note: The deployed version typically leverages a persistent backend service, which may differ from the local JSON Server setup, ensuring data persistence and scalability.)*

### **4.2. üíª Local Development Setup**
This section provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for setting up and running ProductFlow in a local development environment, ideal for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

#### **4.2.1. ‚úÖ System Prerequisites**
*   **Node.js:** Ensure Node.js (LTS version recommended for stability and compatibility) is installed on your system.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn:** These package managers are indispensable for efficient dependency management and project scaffolding.

#### **4.2.2. ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation Procedure**
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual repository URL and project directory name. This step retrieves the entire codebase.)*

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
    *(This command downloads and installs all necessary React libraries and project dependencies.)*

3.  **Configure JSON Server:**
    *   **Global Installation:** If JSON Server is not already installed globally on your system, execute:
        ```bash
        npm install -g json-server
        # OR
        yarn global add json-server
        ```
        *(This installs JSON Server as a global command-line utility.)*
    *   **Database File Creation:** Create a file named `db.json` in your project's root directory with the following initial structure:
        ```json
        {
          "product": []
        }
        ```
        *(This file will serve as the mock database for your product data during local development and testing.)*

#### **4.2.3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Application Launch**
1.  **Start JSON Server (Backend):**
    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
    ```
    *(This command launches the mock API server, making your local data accessible, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.)*

2.  **Start React Development Server (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```
    *(This command compiles and serves the React application. The application will typically open automatically in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port), providing the user interface.)*
